Description: Non linear dot plots are diagrams that allow dots of varying size to be constructed, so that columns with a large number of samples are reduced in height. Implementation of algorithm described in: Nils Rodrigues and Daniel Weiskopf, "Nonlinear Dot Plots", IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics, vol. 24, no. 1, pp. 616-625, 2018. <doi:10.1109/TVCG.2017.2744018>.
